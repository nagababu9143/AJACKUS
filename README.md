## Challenges Faced

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the interface works well across all device sizes
2. **State Management**: Managing complex filter, sort, and pagination state
3. **Form Validation**: Implementing comprehensive client-side validation
4. **Modal Management**: Handling multiple modals and their interactions
5. **Performance**: Optimizing DOM updates for large datasets

## Future Enhancements

If given more time, the following improvements could be implemented:

1. **Data Persistence**: Local storage or IndexedDB integration
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, multiple selection filters
3. **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export capabilities
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select and delete multiple employees
5. **Employee Photos**: Avatar upload and display
6. **Department Management**: Dynamic department creation
7. **Role Hierarchy**: Role-based permissions
8. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with highlights
9. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user keyboard navigation
10. **Data Validation**: Server-side validation simulation

## Freemarker Integration Notes

While this implementation uses vanilla JavaScript for demonstration, the application can be easily integrated with Freemarker templates:

```html
<!-- Example Freemarker integration -->
<#assign employees = [
  {"id": 1, "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Smith", "email": "alice@example.com", "department": "HR", "role": "Manager"},
  {"id": 2, "firstName": "Bob", "lastName": "Johnson", "email": "bob@example.com", "department": "IT", "role": "Developer"}
]>

<script>
  // Load data from Freemarker
  const employees = [
    <#list employees as employee>
      {
        id: ${employee.id},
        firstName: "${employee.firstName}",
        lastName: "${employee.lastName}",
        email: "${employee.email}",
        department: "${employee.department}",
        role: "${employee.role}"
      }<#if employee_has_next>,</#if>
    </#list>
  ];
</script>
```
